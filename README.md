# Python-Image-Resizer

A lightweight image resizer built using Python and OpenCV. Resize images by width, height, or scale factor while preserving quality. Ideal for quick image optimization tasks.
A sample image (`335934.jpg`) is provided to test the script. Run the code and compare the original and resized versions.
